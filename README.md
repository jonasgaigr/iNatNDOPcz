Quantifying the role of iNaturalist in providing species occurrence data in Czechia to evaluate citizen science tools' potential contribution to Nature Restoration Regulation reporting. Looking at several taxonomic groups of biodiversity conservation or indicator value:
- Hymenoptera 
- Beeflies and hoverflies 
- Beetle species under the Habitat's Directive

The contribution is assessed by evaluating the percentage of mapping fields with species occurrence known a) exclusively based on iNaturalist records and b) on all records including those sourced from iNaturalist.
